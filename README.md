*Project Title* :  Machine Learning Model Implementation using Python

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes, using the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. I chose the Random Forest Classifier for this task because of its robustness, accuracy, and ability to highlight feature importance.

The dataset contains several health-related variables like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and age, collected from female patients of Pima Indian heritage. I started by loading and exploring the dataset, then prepared the data through train-test splitting and feature scaling. After training the Random Forest model, I evaluated its performance using classification metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1-score.

Additionally, I visualized the feature importances to better understand which health indicators contribute most to the predictions.

*Key Steps I Followed* : 

Loaded the dataset directly from an online source.

Explored and summarized the data to get insights into feature distributions and class imbalance.

Preprocessed the data by scaling features and splitting into train/test sets.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier with 100 estimators.

Evaluated the model using metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

Plotted the feature importances to identify the most influential predictors.

*Outcome* :

The model performed well in identifying patients at risk of diabetes. The feature importance plot also helped me understand which medical indicators had the most predictive power, with glucose, BMI, and age emerging as top contributors.
